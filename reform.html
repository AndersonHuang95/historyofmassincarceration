<p><span class="fancy">S</span>o much money is going into the the prison system, but research, specifically, Roeder's report,<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/what-caused-crime-decline">What Caused the Crime Decline</a> documents that incarceration has had little to no effeect on reducing crime between 2000-2013. All the while, violent crime has dropped by more than half, peroperty crime has been reduced by 43 percent, and imprisonment has gone up by 61 percent. We can easily divert the money we are pouring into the prison system into community-enriching programs.</p>
<p>Instead of building more prisons, instead of giving up on troubled youth and current offenders, we can build community-based outreach programs to make sure inner-city children don't end up in the jail system and prisoners now don't end up relapsing back into prison. Instead of racial profiling and scapegoating, we can reform the legislative laws in place, giving fairer sentences to all, and reducing the War on Drugs. Instead of pointing fingers, instead of putting the blame on this or that, we can embrace change and build a better society. </p>

<p>A large portion of the prison population is made up of substance abuse offenders and mentally ill. More or less, we are letting these people rot in their cells without the help that they need. In fact, according to the Legislative Analyst's Office of California, the annual cost of housing an inmate is $47,102. To put that into perspective, that is more than the annual cost of attending UCLA, or many other universities for that matter. A better alternative is to stop viewing these people as second-class; we are all human. While also drastically reducing the amounts of money we are wasting, we can concurrently build drug treatment centers for drug addicts and we can build mental health institutions for the ill. To take it further, released convicts should not be stigmatized for their past actions but given a chance at reassimilating through reentry programs. Too often after release, prisoners relapse. Again, we are quick to assume "That's because he or she was a bad person to begin with." But this is the exact mindset that has led us into the era of mass incarceration and how we continue to be stuck in this cycle of dependency.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people think that the prison system can't be fixed, and that notion is completely wrong. Solutions are out there, but communities need to get the ball rolling and to mount support for these alternatives. For example, Donald Cohen, executive director of <a href="http://www.inthepublicinterest.org/?everything=everything">In the Public Interest</a>, argues that reentry programs giving employment assistance and substance abuse therapy only costs $1,200 per person, opposed to the $47,000 it costs to lock up a that same person. Per Cohen's blog on Huffington Post, "If our criminal justice system stopped sending people to private jails and prisons, hundreds of millions in tax dollars a year could be spent on providing rehabilitation and alternatives to incarceration.</p>

<p>I had the chance to visit <a href="http://www.homeboyindustries.org/">Homeboy Industries</a>, a nonprofit organization offering the tools for reentry to the previously gang-affiliated and formerly incarcerated. Their vision and their mission statement is a model of excellence and one that provides hope that one day we truly reform the system. Some of their most notable services are free tattoo removal, tutoring and educational courses, employment (through placement or through the bakery they run), legal services, mental health services, and technical training. Being there really transformed my view of the prison system, and it gave me hope that reform is not only possible, but that it is in the near future.</p>
