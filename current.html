<p><span class="fancy">T</span>oday, the United States is the world leader in number of persons incarcerated per capita and Los Angeles houses the largest prison population of any Californian City. To put this into perspective, America has 5% of the world's population &mdash; and <em>25%</em> of the world's prison population. Similarly, Los Angeles represents 27% of California's total population, but <em>40%</em> of its prison population.
Perhaps even more telling is the fact that California has 29 universities &mdash; and 33 prisons. What does that say about California as a state, or the United States as a whole?</p>

<span id="quote">"...the war on Drugs has been an utter failure." - Barack Obama (2004)</span>
<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/lost-in-detention/">Lost in Detention</a> and <a href="http://www.visionsofabolition.org/">Visions of Abolition</a> are telling documentaries that expose what is going on in the United States as a whole. The story starts with the numbers. In the past decade, over $100 billion per year has been spent on policing and over $60 billion per year has been spent on prisons. In fact, the War on Drugs has led to the development of a prison industrial complex. It has gotten to a point where we, as a nation, have grown dependent on jails. Whether the prisons be publicly or privately owned, workers now depend on jails for jobs, and jails line the pockets of private corporations. Given such excessive budgets, larger and larger prisons have been built, and the pressure is on to fill these jails. And to fill these jails, law enforcement has turned to racial profiling to increase and sustain the number of arrests. Today, 75% of the U.S. drug users are white. 15% of U.S. drug users are black. A whopping <em>84%</em> of convicted drug users are, as you may have guessed, black. Another blaring discrepancy exists &mdash; the draconian sentencing associated with crack cocaine versus that of powder cocaine. Before 2010, persons charged with possession with 1 gram of crack cocaine were given the same sentence as persons carrying 100 grams of powder cocaine. This is a 100:1 disparity. Even after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Sentencing_Act">Fair Sentencing Act</a> of 2010, the gulf has only dropped to 18:1. What is often misportrayed is that cocaine is not as bad as crack cocaine, when in fact they are the same drug. Crack cocaine is a cheaper, more portable version of the fact. But the fact that we sentence crack users speaks a lot to what goes on with law enforcement in the United States.</p>

<p>It just so happens that powder cocaine users are rich and white. It just so happens that crack cocaine users are poor and black. But this is not really a coincidence. When President George Bush addressed the nation in 1989 on drug policy, he attributed the cause of society's problems to cocaine, and in particular crack cocaine, saying "Who's reponsible? Everyone who uses drugs, everyone who sells drugs, and everyone who looks the other way...[crack] is as innocent-looking as candy, but it's turning our cities into battle zones, and it's murdering our children." In the 1980s, even today, crack is being scapegoating for unemployment, poor education, violence, and many more problems, when in fact it is not the root of the problem. But in the wake of this war on crack, on drugs, we have created a system of <em>legislated criminality</em>, where the laws make the criminals. When in fact both whites, blacks, Mexicans, Asians, or whatever race may use drugs, we have learned to look the other way. Instead, law enforcements targets those who <em>they</em> deem to be dangerous: colored people living in the inner city.</p>
<p>There's a saying, "Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it." We do not have to look very far back to see the discrimination that minorities have had to face. The Constitution was founded on the belief that slaves counted as three-fifths of a person. Slavery was not voluntarily abolished; a whole civil war was fought to end the practice. The Native Americans, the Chinese, the Mexicans all share a similar story of exclusion, discrimination, and oppression. And now, into the 21st century, <em>we have made full circle</em>.</p>
<p>Consciously or not, we as a nation have made it a practice to profile someone. It has a been a practice passed down century to century. Here in the 21st century, we have created slavery by another name.</p>

<p>Everyday, $5 million is spent to detain immigrants. This year, 400,000 illegal immigrants will be deported. With no reform available due to opposition from Republicians, deportation has risen to new heights. Presently, the Department of Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement(ICE) follow detention center quotas that they are forced to meet. With this kind of thinking in mind, this enforcement to not look at alternatives. This type of policing has led to ridiculous amounts of deportations and ridiculous reasons for deportation. Last year, 195,000 people were deported. Of those, 1,000 were charged as murderers, 5,000 were convicted of sexual assault, and 45,000 were serious drug offenders. Although there is some merit to the deportations, approximately 75% of those deported were never committed of a serious crime, and this has led to a lot of collateral damage. Innocent fathers have been separated from mothers. Innocent mothers have been separated from her children. To compound the problem, those arrested by immigration enforcement are held indefinitely in detention centers, where the average case time takes months to years. We strip these immigrants of their fundamental rights given in the Constitution, and we argue that deportation is not punishment. We have created a feeling of delibrate indifference towards immigration enforcement. The whole concept of deportation is complicated and a clear-cut solution will be hard to find, but we can start by giving immigrants the constitutional rights they deserve. </p>
