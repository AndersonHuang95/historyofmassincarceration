<p><span class="fancy">P</span>resent day, Los Angeles is regarded as one of the most culturally diverse cities in the
United States and the world. However, the same city that boasts such diversity is also home to
California's largest prison population. To understand this divide, let's take a look at Los Angeles's rich, but troubled past.</p>

<p>As historian Patrick Wolfe stated, “Settler colonialism is inherently eliminatory but not invariably genocidal.” To put it another way, incarceration, imprisonment, and even more generally, elimination are inherent tools that settler colonialism uses to achieve its goals. When white settlers began to flood Los Angeles in the mid 1800s, it was not long before the Native American population declined. Most of these settlers were Anglo-Saxons, and like the others who flooded to the western United States, they were attempting to fulfill manifest destiny, the idea that it was their divine right to conquer the western part of the continent. But <em>why</em> is settler colonialism eliminatory?</p>
<img src="http://img-cache.oppcdn.com/img/v1.0/s:26127/t:QkxBTksrVEVYVCtIRVJF/p:12/g:tl/o:2.5/a:50/q:90/1640x830-g2H1ejPEJSWiPHt5.jpg/1116x830/54ac3e18fa5d7d450451e6dbb4b8d019.jpg" alt="American Progress" id="progress">
<p>The root of the answer is utopianism. A new society comes with a predetermined image. The white Anglo-Saxons that came to colonize Los Angeles had a picture of a new society that was, well, Anglo-Saxon. Needless to say, the Native Americans did not fit their ideal mold of a citizen. From the mid-1800s to early 1900s, the population of Indians in Los Angeles nearly disappeared. To justify the elimination of Native Americans, they were often looked down upon as "savages", much like how settlers justified slavery by viewing African Americans as less than human, as objects. I found this especially profound, as this is how we view prisoners in our society today, but more on this later. </p>
<p>But as time progresses, a contradiction develops. Although these minorities, these Indians (and later Chinese, Mexican, Japanese, and African Americans) were not desirable in the eyes
of the settlers, they were essential to a cheap labor force. Labor without the laborer was the slogan, essentially. To achieve this means, several laws were passed &mdash; namely An Act To Punish Vagrants (1855), which allowed for the arrest of any person a begger or jobless could be arrested and put to work. </p>
<p> This same methodology was applied to the Chinese, who came from overseas and were used as cheap labor for building the railroads. Often dangerous and life-threatening work, they toiled for just a few cents on the day. However, a new side to settler colonialism came to life &mdash; racial exclusion. As the Chinese began to assimiliate, they were viewed as a threat to society. The thought of a "yellow invasion" was real in many settler's minds, and this led to the passing of discriminatory acts such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Exclusion_Act">Chinese Exclusion Act</a>. Although the targeted group was different, the oppression was still one and the same.</p>
<p> At the turn of the 1920s, Los Angeles had become home to a large subpopulation of Mexicans and blacks alike. Again, like the groups discriminated against before them, many immigrants
from Mexico were put in detention centers (a practice perpetuated to this day), and blacks were discriminated against by such practices as segregation of public places. As history shows us, discrimination is not a new construct, and it is still very real today, in the form of prisons and mass incarceration.</p>

<p>I think it would be a stretch to say that settler colonialism has directly led to the problem of mass incarceration in not just Los Angeles, but int the United States today, but it has definitely had an indirect impact in that it has primed society into scapegoating and targeting certain racial or socio-economic groups. As we have seen with Native Americans, Chinese immigrants, Mexican immigrants, and African American migrants, race is invisible to discrimination. But these minority groups, these groups that do not fit the utopian image(which has changed throughout time), are often the first to be blamed when things go awry. When jobs were in shortage for white laborers in the early 19th century and 1920s, the Chinese and Mexican laborers were blamed as they were viewed as cheap sources of labor. To discriminate against them, the government could not outright say that "We're going to treat you differently because you are Chinese or Mexican", so they used an indirect form of discrimination through drugs. The Chinese were main users of opium, and the Mexicans in the 1920s were main users of marijuana, so laws were levied against drug users, which happened to racially profile the Chinese and Mexicans during their respective times. </p> 
<p> This leads us to the 1970s through present day. In 1971, then President Richard Nixon declared a war on drugs. This, in conjunction with a war on crime, dramatically increased U.S. spending on drug and crime enforcement. And with this budget came with the expectation of arresting more drug users and more criminals. Eventually, the law enforcement began to target undesirables, much like in the past. The idea was that drugs were vile and made someone into an insane criminal. Fed with this propaganda, law enforcement began to drug users, who happened to be inner city minorities &mdash; blacks and Latinos &mdash; when in fact that back then and today still, <em>the majority of drug users are white</em>. As time has gone on, the story has been the same. Society continues to find a way to label those they deem unfit for society, to target them individually, and put them away. Current day, this process has manifested itself in the War on Drugs, and the victims are mainly poor African Americans and Latinos.</p>
